# Getting Started

## Generate a Feed

For example, if you want to subscribe to the content of the channel [@awesomeRSSHub](https://t.me/awesomeRSSHub) on Telegram.

According to the [Telegram route](/routes/social-media#telegram) documentation, the route is `/telegram/channel/:username/:routeParams?`, where username is a required parameter and routeParams is an optional parameter. Replace `:username` with the channel id awesomeRSSHub to get the path `/telegram/channel/awesomeRSSHub`, then add the instance domain `https://rsshub.app`, a subscription source is generated: `https://rsshub.app/telegram/channel/awesomeRSSHub`.

Then you can add `https://rsshub.app/telegram/channel/awesomeRSSHub` to any RSS reader for use.

The instance domain `https://rsshub.app` can be replaced with  your [self-hosted instance](/deploy) or any [public instance](/guide/instances).

In addition, RSSHub supports many useful parameters, such as content filtering, full-text output, etc., refer to [Parameters](/guide/parameters) for details.
